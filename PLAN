Things to do, improve, add...


* Add certificates management to handle HTTPS servers

I think Riton will work on it.


* Add support for "offline" metadata files.
The idea behind this is to be able to disable webfs current behavior
which download "description.data" from webserver to get metadata
informations.
This is fine for own-controled websites, but not for "any" sites.

The goal is to make webfs just use a localy generated metadata file,
whitout having to deal with downloading/generating it.
The goal is also to provide tools that would be able to generate the
same informations with regular HTTP access for a given site (typicaly
using HEAD requests to build the files/dirs tree and get the other
metadata informations).

I think I (Hexasoft) will work on it (at least in webfs code).


* Modify code in order to have a separate task for the cache system.
The goal would be to have a cache system that can receive requests and
send data to webfs main code, but still behing able to perform some
tasks in background. The most interested one should be to perfom
readahead on opened files.


* To make a decent documentation


* Add a loglevel option at startup, with a syslog output (and not a
local file as it is now).
